Description: Starting from metabolite codes from both KEGG and HMDB databases, the functions look for related enzymes, genes and metabolic pathways. 
            Then, another set of functions use the genes obtained to search in different databases (PubMed, OMIM, GEO and Entrez Nucleotide) to obtain 
            information already published of the metabolites of interest in all these 4 databases.
